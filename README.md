# project-tracking-intro-component
<h3>this is my attempt to solve the coding challenge suggested by Front-ENd mentor </br>

:arrow_forward: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/project-tracking-intro-component-5d289097500fcb331a67d80e </br>

the challenge is to build out this intro component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.:facepunch:
should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create the background shape using code
